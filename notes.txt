1. create a location entry for users in th User model and form.
2. create the user_city = self.user.city or however location is entered in the user table
3. make sure the location from the form entry is sent throught the thunbk into the api route
then query filter the vehicles by location=host_location

see if you can pass in all the booking information into the vehicle list item so when you click book it can send a
payload to the thunk with the booking info and vehicle information

the thunk will send it to api/bookings/create

there it will create a booking with a guest host vehicle and dates
